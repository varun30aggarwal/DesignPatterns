Bridge Pattern allows the seperation of abstraction from implementation. Abstrat and Implementation can be developed independently and
client code can access abstraction part without knowing the implementation.In this example we have a abstract class printer which can 
extend to different printer type and implementation as Formatter. Printer is using composition to pass formateer instance. Using this 
there is a clear seperation of functionalities.
